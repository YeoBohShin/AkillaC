Searching up cheatsheets/exam papers usually end up with students on studuco studying through poorly documented past year papers, with answer sheets being another ordeal where students have to search thoroughly to find. Hence, a new NUS based system where students can upload cheatsheets, past year papers and answer sheets will alleviate this problem.

Each semesterâ€™s module classes will typically create a separate telegram group chat where students co learn and share knowledge with one another. However, this information typically does not get passed down to future generations of the same module, which will result in a lot of valuable information lost. Hence by consolidating the forum pages of each module, we will enable these information to be trickled down and benefit future students of the same module.

<ins>Aim</ins>

We hope to make a discussion forum and database which is friendly, easy to access and efficient.
We hope to make the platform have functions that can store past year materials for students to revise.

<ins>User Stories</ins>

Users can view past year exam papers and answers.

Users can answer questions posted by other users.

Users can ask questions about certain exam papers / concepts of the module.

Users can search for a module and view related modules.

Users can report troll answers.

Administrators can issue warnings and ban users who are reported by others.
